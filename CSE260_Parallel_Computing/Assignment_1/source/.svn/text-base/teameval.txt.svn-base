                        Team Self Evaluation Form

Each team must submit one copy of this self evaluation form. 
The members of each team should discuss how they
worked together and what to write for the evaluation.

(1) List the names of your team members:

A: Andreas Prodomou

 
B: Samuel Wasmundt

 
C:

 
(2) Estimate how much time each team member devoted to this project, in HOURS.

  	                        A 25 	       B 25             C
meetings 2	  	  	 
coding 19	  	  	 
writeup 3	  	  	 
planning (alone) 1 	  	  	 
total (including meetings) 25	  	  	 


(3) Describe 
	Adreas devoted a lot of time to the initial work of getting the svn
setup, and working on getting the cache blocking implemented. Sam then built
off of Andreas work and implemented the SSE matrix multiplication that was
able to handle any blocksize as well as any matrix sizes.

	At that point we worked together to look at the code and integrate
further optimizations such as write combining, 0 padding and temp array
alignment, and others that proved to be not as benefitial such as transposing
B. 
	For the write up, we pretty much split this up with each person
writing the specifics for the code/optimizations that person implemented. 

(a) what the major responsibilities of each team member were;
	Andreas - getting initial svn setup, cache blocking, memory alignment

	Sam - SSE Intrinsics, matrix multiplication of any dimensions and
handling the boundary cases. 

	Both - loop unrolling, write combining, transpose B, writeup

(b) whether or not you completed the assignment;
	Neither of us had specific assignments, since we share an office space
there is an open line of communication about the progress and we
collaboratively worked towards completion.

(c) the major strengths and weaknesses in your team, e.g. how
    your team worked together;
	Strengths: communication, both have a computer architecture background
which helps with the conceptual understanding of the projects. 
	Weaknesses: communication :) we tend to both think we are correct on
occasion. 
	
(d) the lessons learned from these events;
	Focus on the major ideas and not get hung up on the little things that
may take a really long time to implement but in the end don't help that much.

(e) whether and how you plan to change the way your work together and
	We worked well together overall, no complaints. 

(f) anything else that comes to mind.
	A better introduction to the use of SSE intrinsic operations would
have been nice.
